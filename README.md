# LearnPythonTheHardWay

## Introduction
This code repo features answers to the exercises from the book "Learn Python The Hard Way", authored by Zed Shaw. 
Members of the Code & Create meetup sessions have gone through this book and published their code here. Feel free to compare your code to it. 
We encourage asking questions regarding the exercises on the #pysty slack channel!&

## Credits
All code posted in this repo are executions of the assignments/exercises of the book "Learn Python The Hard Way" by "Zed (A.) Shaw".

4) Push the branch to the remote upstream (GitHub).
5) Issue a pull request against the `dev` branch of this repo.

### Naming and Content
Please make sure that the code solutions do not add the original assignment. E.g. quoting the assignment as a docstring or by commenting it out. 
Although we agree this is useful for both the reader and the coder, it may be impolite to quote large portions or work. 

We prefer if your filename would have an unique identifier, e.g. `exc_2_1_vince-nieuw` rather than `exc_2_1`. The lather may cause naming collisions rather quickly.
