1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it’s just 4?
No, it works the same. 
2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It’s just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.

3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that its purpose is to give data (numbers, strings, etc.) names (cars_driven, passengers).
Adds the value to the variable
5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.
Ok
6. Try running python3.6 from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before, and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names include i, x, and j.”
